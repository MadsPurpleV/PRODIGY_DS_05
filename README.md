# PRODIGY_DS_05

This project analyzes a synthetic dataset of road accidents to uncover patterns and trends. The dataset includes variables such as hour of the day, weather conditions, road conditions, and accident severity.

# Task-5: Road Accident Analysis
Analyzed a synthetic dataset of road accidents to identify patterns and trends. The data includes hour, weather, road conditions, and accident severity. Performed EDA with visualizations to highlight accidents by hour, weather, and severity by road conditions. Insights help understand risk factors and improve road safety.

This project analyzes a synthetic dataset of road accidents to uncover patterns and trends related to accident severity.

It is part of my **Prodigy Internship Data Science - Task 5**.

## Insights

* Accidents occur more frequently during certain **peak hours** of the day.
* Weather conditions like **Rain** and **Storm** increase accident frequency.
* **Icy** and **Wet** road conditions correlate with higher accident severity.
* Visual analysis helps in identifying **risk factors** and improving road safety measures.
